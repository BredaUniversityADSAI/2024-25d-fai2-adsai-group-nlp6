# Pre-Commit Hooks Guide

This repository uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency before changes are committed. Below are the key issues that these hooks check for and how to avoid them.

## Hooks and Common Issues

### 1. Trailing Whitespace (`trailing-whitespace`)
**Issue:** Extra spaces at the end of lines.
**Fix:** Remove unnecessary trailing spaces in your code files.

### 2. End-of-File Fixer (`end-of-file-fixer`)
**Issue:** Missing newline at the end of a file.
**Fix:** Always ensure that each file ends with a newline character.

### 3. YAML Syntax Check (`check-yaml`)
**Issue:** Invalid YAML formatting.
**Fix:** Validate YAML files using online tools or a linter before committing.

### 4. Large File Detection (`check-added-large-files`)
**Issue:** Committing excessively large files.
**Fix:** Avoid adding large files to the repository unless necessary. Consider using `.gitignore` to exclude them.

### 5. Flake8 (`flake8`)
**Issue:** Python code style violations (PEP8), unused variables, and syntax errors.
**Fix:** Run `flake8` locally and address warnings before committing.

### 6. Black (`black`)
**Issue:** Code formatting inconsistencies.
**Fix:** Run `black` on your Python files to ensure consistent formatting.

### 7. Isort (`isort`)
**Issue:** Incorrectly ordered imports in Python files.
**Fix:** Run `isort` to organize imports in the recommended order.

## Best Practices

- **Run pre-commit locally**: Before committing, execute `pre-commit run --all-files` to ensure your code meets standards.
- **Automate formatting**: Use `black` and `isort` regularly to keep code clean and consistent.
- **Validate YAML files**: Improper YAML formatting can break configurations; always verify before committing.
- **Optimize large files**: If committing large data files, consider alternative storage solutions.

I could see it in the reflection of the door.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
Then they left.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

If we had said the toughest persecution here after 2-3 hours.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"Lick me by the ass, Marie.",anger,moderate,anger,0,2,1
We didn't find anything around the block where the last PIN was from DR1.,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
We also didn't see anything where he could hide,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
without having to cope with a huge obstacle.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

"They will wait for the PIN, people.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
They won't go to another zone now.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
They will wait for this PIN and try to land me.,nervousness,moderate,fear,2,19,1
"And we have day 1, people.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
The pin comes 28 minutes.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Mega. Really mega. Real.,excitement,strong,happiness,3,13,2
"So, now a bit hidden, deep camera.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
On the distance I saw someone with a tank top.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
I will check now.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"The cool WU likes to wear tank tops, the good one.",amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
And then we have to see.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
He wants to flex with his biceps.,amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
But then unfortunately we have to turn it on the back.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Oh, that's right. I'm on the radio.",realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
My team listens to what I'm going on.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
It is now three quarters ten.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We didn't get any coordinates at nine o'clock.,disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
On the grounds that the players are not in the center zone.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That means we can get the coordinates again at ten o'clock.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We now need a game line or operations management for half an hour.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And we have to be in thirty at ten o'clock.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That is a requirement again.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Because then we move out together to the daily ring.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That's why we don't make ourselves too much stress now.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Somehow I still have hope or I suspect,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
that the players are here in the center zone.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Even if we didn't get the nine o'clock locations.,disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
Just on the grounds that they are outside.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I still think that they are not far from the center zone.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"In addition, you have to move back to the Center Zone.",annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
Also for the daily ring.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"That means they won't run kilometers outside,",realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
to run back for miles.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We have now met Willi and Julius on the street.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
They are already at the northern end,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Because they saw someone with tank top.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
And we know cool WU is there.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
And cool WU is a tank top type.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
The person with the tank top is just gone.,surprise,mild,surprise,6,27,0
I am now positioned here northwest of the Khaosan Road.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"We divided ourselves here on the left, right.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We see that we remain hidden how it works.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Julius and I are here. Stefan and Kathi are slowly moving up.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That we are ready to make decisions or driving very quickly.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Depending on where the pinks are.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Yes, Armin knows. We are waiting for 10 a.m.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
who is near Khaosan. So he quickly checks all pinks.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Look if a player is there. We only have 5 minutes about about 5 minutes.,fear,moderate,fear,2,14,1
"When one is there, we do Hotzone and go on it.",optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
"If he is gone further than 5 or 10 minutes,",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Then we have to lay back, because otherwise it doesn't work out",disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
With our 10.30 a.m. meeting.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
The planned strategy now for the morning and noon.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
The players will probably not leave the transmitter,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Because a, we really have to save money here in the first phase.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"We must be at 12 p.m. for the daily challenge in the broadcast person,",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
that takes place in the transmitter person.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Willi and Colt, you can stay in the transmitter person",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Or pull back into the transmitter.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Armin, we are looking forward to the quality of the next few minutes.",optimism,mild,happiness,3,21,0
"Yes, somehow no chance on the block.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Very confusing here. Not so much going on,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
But really great.,amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
"Yes, let's go again.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Let's go back to the operations center.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Guys, I'll show you the reflection that I have seen.",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
I photographed it with my cell phone.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Look at it, people.",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
This is the door opposite the machine where I was sitting.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Here I once zoomed in and then took the picture here.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
There is a hunter. Military clothing.,surprise,moderate,surprise,6,27,1
You can easily see the GoPro.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
So I was pretty unsure whether it really is.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"People, the reflection really saved my ass.",relief,moderate,happiness,3,24,1
Otherwise I would have been careless about the machine.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I genth myself.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And then I would be here with my arm, there with my arm",confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
and I saw this scooter beforehand,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Where one filmed with the GoPro on the back.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Age, so one has a braid, dressed brown, capped.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And the other looked like Stefan.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Black shirt, full beard, although I haven't seen that at all.",confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
I know he has a full beard.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Maybe he doesn't have one anymore. Definitely black shirt.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
GoPro could have been Stefan.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"And yes, Stefan, I said yes.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"You always see each other twice in life, my friend.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
But not yet. Not yet.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I am excited to see what the reaction will end.,excitement,moderate,happiness,3,13,1
Me too.,excitement,mild,happiness,3,13,0
"Okay, come on.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
So it starts.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Player 8.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"All of Armin, no player near the Corsan Road.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Question understood, come.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Put it in.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Stefan and Kathi understood, we embarrassed, we lay.",embarrassment,mild,fear,2,12,0
We are offline.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
So you don't see anything in this bend.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
But there are also a few pedestrians.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Parole.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Thank you very much.,gratitude,mild,happiness,3,15,0
"Yes, no success. Too bad.",disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
So we have now gained really good experiences.,optimism,mild,happiness,3,21,0
It's super confusing.,confusion,moderate,surprise,6,6,1
"So a lot going on. Well, there are not many tourists.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That's a bit of help.,relief,mild,happiness,3,24,0
But the alleys are so winding between the streets.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
This is sick when there is one.,disgust,mild,disgust,1,11,0
You actually have to drive through every street and then you have to be there for yourself.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We have to discuss the strategy again and see,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
As we do in the second round or after the challenge.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
So the first challenge came in again.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
On WhatsApp.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
First challenge. Difficulty level.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
The first sound shade is the hunt for the Hunter.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"A challenge zone is set in the Center Zone, more precisely in Chinatown.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
All Hunter must be in this zone from 12 noon.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
The players now have to take photos of the Hunger and transmit them to the game management.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
There are three hours of catch-free to win per photo.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
No coordinates are passed on during this period.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And a catch is invalid.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
A maximum of two photos are recognized.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
So there is up to six hours of catch-free to win the challenge.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
But it is dangerous because the Hunter can also hunt during the challenge.,fear,mild,fear,2,14,0
"However, the zone must always remain occupied by at least four hunters.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Thus three Hunter are allowed to follow the players.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
A Speed ​​Hunt is not allowed during this challenge.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Only when the operations management is occupied.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
The first challenge is coming up at 12 noon.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I have to go back to Central and I'll try that.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I want to deliver content.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And above all, I want the opportunity not to be pinked for three or six hours.",desire,moderate,happiness,3,8,1
Provided you win the challenge.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
So I'm going to the Central.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I will still think about how I do it.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Either there by taxi or with the scooter taxi.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I don't know exactly yet.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
I'm going in the direction.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I definitely have to be careful.,fear,moderate,fear,2,14,1
"We are now going, watch out, now to the challenge.",excitement,moderate,happiness,3,13,1
I'll try it.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Armin and I will make the decoys in the middle.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Because they know us, we are already burned anyway.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Look that you are defended as possible.,fear,moderate,fear,2,14,1
Of course in compliance with the rules.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"There you are one group of 19, the other from here.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"But maybe not in 90 degrees, a little further down, a little low-key.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
The Julius stays as close as possible with his moped.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Of course in the zone so that we are in the control panel.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
So that he can also record the persecution with the moped as soon as possible.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We definitely have the opportunity to catch someone.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
"Exactly where the arrow looks, there is a cross.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And a little further is another cross.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"That means there are not only 4 exits, but 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 exits.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
But we only have 4 people who can hunt.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Because Armin and I are the decoys inside.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And only 3 are allowed to leave the zone, that's a bit crisp.",annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
"Hey guys, it continues, but before that an important note.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"As mentioned in the previous episode, such a project would simply not be possible without sponsors.",gratitude,mild,happiness,3,15,0
And we couldn't do that.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That's why we got support.,gratitude,mild,happiness,3,15,0
Urquelle is a big fan of Manhunt and has agreed to support us.,gratitude,moderate,happiness,3,15,1
"Exactly, and who is a source at all?",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
This is a young company that specializes in the filtering of water.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And has a solution for the outdoor area, whether your camping or adventure in the outdoor area.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Namely a suitcase with which we always make fresh drinking water.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That was also a huge topic in Bangkok.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
How do the participants get fresh water?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
This suitcase solves the problem.,relief,moderate,happiness,3,24,1
You can use it to make fresh drinking water quickly and without electricity.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Is that also a backpack?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Sure, it is nothing for flight now.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"But honestly, who of us is constantly on the run?",amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
"Exactly, Max has already tried it.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
He was thrilled.,excitement,strong,happiness,3,13,2
I was.,excitement,strong,happiness,3,13,2
So drop by the shop.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
With our manhunt discount code you get 3% and order the set.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
You always have clean drinking water for your adventures.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And now I would say adventure was the keyword.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
It starts right away.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"If we catch a player, I definitely want Armin to be one who puts it in.",optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
Kathi unnd Kon.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I just take the running principle now.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
I need the strongest robbers outside.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
"These are just Willi, Adrian and Julius.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"We are now here in the Center Zone, at this park, where I was before.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
It would actually be smart to run the same routes.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
That's why I still have 11 minutes to let myself be fishing here somewhere else.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And then briefly cousin road, I think.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Or directly to the challenge.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
What worries me is that they will patrol somewhere here.,fear,moderate,fear,2,14,1
Because afterwards they have to go to this zone anyway.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Age, in the heat.",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
That is unbearable.,annoyance,strong,anger,0,3,2
"And the thing is, you can no longer look forward to at night.",disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
It is just as warm and humid there.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
I'm even sultry than now.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
What would I do for that?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
For such an ice coffee or something?,desire,moderate,happiness,3,8,1

What do you get for it?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Six hours, what?",confusion,moderate,surprise,6,6,1
"Yes, we have to do that somehow.",optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
I will put on my disguise,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
And just give me in there.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
It's funny that we are doing it at the moment.,amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
I can't ...,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
I have no ideas at all.,confusion,moderate,surprise,6,6,1
That and over the backpack.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

There are really a lot of stands in it.,surprise,mild,surprise,6,27,0
Insanely bad view.,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
You can't say labyrinth. That's a beer garden.,amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
It is also difficult for coordination.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Okay, run here, run there.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
But they also have to go very close to us.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And of course that is also an advantage.,optimism,mild,happiness,3,21,0
You can't take pictures of it from a distance.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Armin and I look for our places and then we can play comfortably.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
coordinate. Please keep your eyes extremely open.,fear,moderate,fear,2,14,1

But I'll drop by. I'm at the start.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I also thought about whether I should just go through the bus.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
But you can't. You shouldn't use published means of transport in the center zone.,disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
And I'm in the center zone.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
This plan does not open from this.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0

I'll have a look here again.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I want to avoid if possible that I can be seen on the big streets.,fear,moderate,fear,2,14,1
Maybe I always want to look out a little here.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Let's see what people have to think of here.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
So I briefly pull off the chest strap.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And then I just film with the small camera practically out of my pocket.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

Not that they can already take pictures of you and then just run away.,fear,moderate,fear,2,14,1

We found out that there are a lot of camps,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0

We then have one and a half smooth.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

Then it's just good morning.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
But it seems that something was going on.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Because then it originated that someone started walking with those slippers.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That has been since that confrontation?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
And have you still addressed the neighbor on those slippers?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0

And I just laughed.,amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
I took my bike and I left.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

And then?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
There was also another situation where I was sitting here with family.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We were laughing.,amusement,moderate,happiness,3,1,1
And the visitor noted that there was a mash.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

The lower neighbor has been living here for four years now.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

We are people of age.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We are no longer party pipers.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

I could still listen to this for hours.,admiration,moderate,happiness,3,0,1
It is actually a pity that I was not in the living room with them.,disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0

But I can also make up from the remark of Meester Visser ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0

And also seen a bit.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I step before we go to the hearing now.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And then we will talk about the case. Okay.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I'll see you later.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We have just seen during the location visit ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That the atmosphere between the two parties has fallen to the freezing point.,sadness,moderate,sadness,5,26,1
And that also applies to trust in each other.,sadness,moderate,sadness,5,26,1
That too is completely gone.,sadness,strong,sadness,5,26,2
Master Visser has done thorough research.,admiration,mild,happiness,3,0,0

And I am very curious about the results of our sound expert.,curiosity,moderate,happiness,3,7,1
We're going to hear that now during the hearing.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
A hearing by the way that Marion will not be.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Because she has indicated that the whole thing has so much impact on her ...,sadness,moderate,sadness,5,26,1
That she would rather wait for the statement of Meester Visser at home.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We naturally respect that.,approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0
Fred takes the honneur hard for her.,caring,mild,happiness,3,5,0
We are going to start.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I'm afraid they will lie again.,fear,moderate,fear,2,14,1
But I have faith in it ...,optimism,mild,happiness,3,21,0
That Master Visser will come to a positive statement through the research.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
To my advantage.,desire,mild,happiness,3,8,0
I hope she gets frightened in the lies at some point.,desire,mild,happiness,3,8,0
Because you can't hold on to that.,disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0

We also heard a few things today.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"But there is no wild party, screaming, screaming.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
The point is that it is about stamping.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Walk with slippers.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And if you hear that for a long time ...,annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
Then that can be very annoying.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"You will come to live there 2014, because you have been living for a long time.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We live there for 16 years.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
But in the beginning you have no problems?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
It didn't bother me at all in the beginning.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
When did it go wrong?,curiosity,moderate,happiness,3,7,1
"There was a situation, I was comfortable with my family.",caring,mild,happiness,3,5,0
"They laughed, we were saying goodbye to each other.",joy,mild,happiness,3,17,0
And there was a mash.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
My visitors that said is it true that your neighbors are stamping?,curiosity,moderate,happiness,3,7,1
"I say, I don't know.",confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
Then we continued to laugh.,amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
"And that stamped, I heard that again.",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"What I thought now, now my climber is breaking.",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"Because I think, what do you want to hand in?",confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
It is possible that you were bothered by the party below ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
And that you then asked attention by stamping?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Stamp? No.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Or something else? No.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Believe me, I've never mashed.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Could it be?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Because first you heard a drill sound from above.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
But that wasn't the neighbor.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
Could it be that you may have heard stamping from other neighbors?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Yes, that can be.",realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
That's why I started asking.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
I did not ring and said ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
You have to stop stamping.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
She has been to the door?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
My wife will have opened the door.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I never opened the door.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Do you get what happens?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Of course you get, that makes sense.",realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
But did she friendly ask if it could be a little less?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
We already know that I am not asking kindly.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"Well, the answer has already been driven.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"You say, if you suffer from something ...",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Then you would come to me.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
But the moment I ask you that afternoon ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Are you drilling and you have an annoying feeling of that ...,annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
Don't talk to me the following days of ...,annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
I don't like how you addressed me.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
And then I have to believe that you would really appeal to me.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
You don't do that. You let your wife do the work.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
I heard a neighbor translate ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That your wife was from the fire.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
"Yes, but that can of course be true ...",realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
Because I work five days a week.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

And when calls are made ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Then I open my wife.,confusion,moderate,surprise,6,6,1
You are going to joke again now.,annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0

"You say that, Mr. Jok.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Yes, but you know, at some point that is just ready.",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
We have had several conversations.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
It is also a liar.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
"Would you like to perform now, Master Visser?",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
It is clear that the trust of you with the upstairs neighbors ...,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1

If I am called a lover of loving three times in one day ...,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
Then the trust is indeed gone.,sadness,moderate,sadness,5,26,1
Can you imagine that there is indeed noise nuisance ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
From your home?,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Not in the way ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That we cause noise nuisance by slippers.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We have an underlay.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

We have a rug.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

And you really hear it?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
I really hear it.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
Do you assume that they do that on purpose?,curiosity,moderate,happiness,3,7,1
"Yes, actually.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Actually.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And especially after the last collision.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
I came to listen this afternoon.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Victor has tried.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And I could indeed hear it.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
But now we are of course talking about a person of 1.90 meters.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Something heavier than my wife.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Your wife is an elf with Victor.,amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0

"Anyway, we have heard Victor walking.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Gopsloffen or Gop shoes? On this one.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
We had bought it especially for the occasion.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And Victor was immediately in love with that he can take them with him tonight.,amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
These are health slippers with a hard sole.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
They are the same as the lady has.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Yes, because these are Mrs.'s slippers.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Also with hard soles.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And then I called Victor.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Are there any more shoes there?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
And then I saw in the shoe cupboard ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Hours slippers were added.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Those are also hard.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And Victor also walked on that.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
So we were able to hear both this ...,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
If we have heard this.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
"Because not of course, because Victor does not fit.",confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
"No, that is clear.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Yes, Mr. Roelofsen.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
You have measured.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Well, what have we heard?",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Walking on slippers, we have indeed heard that.",realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
The slippers that Victor has walked on ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
They made between 32 and 38 decibels of sound.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And did that still matter?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Yes, the slippers made of sir made more noise.",realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
More? Yes.,surprise,mild,surprise,6,27,0
Values ​​were measured up to 40 decibels.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
So they were sometimes slightly higher than the sound of the slippers.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
"Okay, clear.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
You hadn't thought that possible?,surprise,mild,surprise,6,27,0
"To be honest, no.",realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
We also looked at the floor itself.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
There is itself as a top layer and laminate under laminate ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And then a very thin layer of foam ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
What should be the noise vapor on the subfloor.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

"I sometimes say, it is art with a large H, from Harry.",pride,mild,happiness,3,22,0

"And there is also, laying hard floor covering ...",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

And all other types of hard floor coverings are allowed ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Provided that there is a good contact sound insulation.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I just summarize it.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
It must dampen 10 decibels.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That's right.,approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0
"Yes, does the floor meet that at the moment?",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Under floor that lies there, I have determined that it does not meet that.",disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
But now that we put the dots on all sides ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I come back to the piano game.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
You have a piano? Beats.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Do you play the piano?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0

Do you even find that very smart in a flat?,disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
Then I didn't live there yet.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
But how should that continue with the piano?,curiosity,moderate,happiness,3,7,1
"Because yes, such a child likes that.",caring,mild,happiness,3,5,0
And I would really like her to continue to do that.,desire,moderate,happiness,3,8,1
"Yes, you can laugh about it, but that's just the case.",annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
It is a bit of one -way traffic now.,disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0

But the question remains ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Even if sir would throw away his slippers ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Then he will have to be able to walk around in his house.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And the question is whether that is possible with the current subfloor ...,curiosity,moderate,happiness,3,7,1
Without that causing a nuisance.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And with regard to the piano playing, there must also be weighed.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

Every sound that I suffer from comes from the upstairs neighbors.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1

Hey. Hi. How did it go?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0

"And vice versa, Jansen hears the piano from Van Essen.",annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
Both sound sources are easy to return ...,optimism,mild,happiness,3,21,0

Jansen can replace his slippers with a hard sole ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Due to soft, well -fitting, so important, preferably filter slippers.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And Van Essen can provide her piano with a so -called current.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And that doesn't have to cost a lot.,relief,mild,happiness,3,24,0
"In my opinion, the current nuisance is a thing of the past.",optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
What you might hear then ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Can hardly be experienced as disturbing.,relief,mild,happiness,3,24,0
Replacement of the subfloor at Jansen ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Strictly speaking does not meet the technical requirements ...,disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
Can also cause the nuisance.,annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
can then be omitted.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And if something was unexpectedly occurred ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"It should not be discussed at the door, in the elevator or in the hall.",disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0

"In such a case, a business, friendly wages is a note ...",approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0
A better solution.,approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0

"Then we have the photos. Yes, we no longer want to end up with your camera.",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
This is a common ground of all eight owners. May I not take photos here?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
It is also my site where I live and where I live. We can't get out of this. No.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
That is why I am very happy that Master Visser has arrived.,relief,moderate,happiness,3,24,1
"But if the cars are just parked in the compartments ... if you just take driving lessons, it will also be solved.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

May I introduce you to Master Frank Visser? Good morning.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Thank you for being there, Master Visser. Well, you're already busy I hear.",gratitude,mild,happiness,3,15,0
"Yes, opposite me too. Hello. You too? Yes.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"This is Mrs. Olga, lives above. This is Mrs. Teunie, who lives above.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And it's about misery, about parked cars and about a lot of mutual battle in this parking lot.",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
Okay. Can I do something for you?,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Yes, we also want to take a look about the camper. That is also the only thing to participate.",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Is a mammoth. Yes, because we see if we get it in between.",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Yes, I am well insured. I'm going to get it. Yes, is good.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Succes.,approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0
"What we are going to do now, I want to know exactly how far the own parking space is.",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
But then those cars have to leave. Can those cars go for a while?,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Yes, the Kunnen away. Yes?",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That says the mammoth.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"You have never really seen it, but big.",surprise,mild,surprise,6,27,0
Instantly blood nerve.,nervousness,moderate,fear,2,19,1
"But we're going to fix it. We're just going to do it. I can do that, this?",optimism,mild,happiness,3,21,0
What do you think at home?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
We asked the surveyors to come.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Well, it's one.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Good day.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"I asked you to come, because the own parking space is drawn in the splissing regulations.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That's right. Then you can also measure it.,approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0
That's right too. Zou je dat voor mij kunnen doen?,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We can certainly do that for you.,approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0
"Well, then I also walk along. Is that complicated?",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0

According to the drawing he starts at the wall.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Tile path is not owned.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

Exactly where those tiles stop.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Take care.,caring,mild,happiness,3,5,0
And how far do you hook now?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Mr. Visser, there is a parking space on the Land Registry.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And here the tiles.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Yes, but there is also a drawing and it is registered in the Land Registry.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And that drawing indicates what the piece of land is, what is exclusively ownership of this apartment.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

I am for that.,approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0

We are on the move.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

I already have a whole bottle ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

It is not that fast.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"No, but it is just like with that free kick, isn't it?",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"If that takes too long, the referee must ...",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Oh, wait a minute.",realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0

Now everyone could clearly see how much that generalization was.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0

"Because oh, oh, what was it going for?",confusion,moderate,surprise,6,6,1
It is obvious that these two neighbor women can no longer air or see each other.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
And that is why I am very happy that Master Visser has been on the spot.,gratitude,mild,happiness,3,15,0
"He has looked at the parking situation very well, together with our surveyor.",approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0
I put the mammoth in place.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And I am actually very curious what Meester Visser thinks about it.,curiosity,moderate,happiness,3,7,1
"We're going to hear that now, because it's time for the hearing.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"If it is unfinished, and you go outside the throat in the hearing,",confusion,moderate,surprise,6,6,1
Then I turn around and then I look the other side.,disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
"And I think people, I already know better, stop with that cross.",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
My expectation from the neighbor is that she will lie everything to each other again.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
"Welcome, we are in this.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"In Sliedrecht, and the issue is the case between Teunie and Olga.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

"You madam, Teunie, you say the walls, we don't park properly.",disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
No. That's what it comes down to.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
"Yes, they park outside the parking space.",disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
It is clearly described in the purchase or delivery acts ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
that you have to stick to the regulations.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And then it is clear, you have a parking space, a garage, a parking space and a terrace.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Yes, you both have the same.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Both are the owner of an apartment right.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Now comes, what is that?",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Legal on the exclusively use of the house on the first and second floor, with a terrace.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Garage and parking space on the ground land.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"So that parking space is, yes, I would say, for you alone.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That is stated in those actions. You bought that.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
But the camper that you put on it does not fit in.,disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
He is just a little too long.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Now, just. Two meters thirty.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"I mean, an Italian gets two more cars in between.",amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
Probably.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And you have a problem with that.,disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
"Yes, because she crosses way too far.",annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
She has to stick to the regulations and not far outside your parking area.,disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
How often is that camper there?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Two or three days before we leave.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And as soon as we come back we clean it and immediately returns to the garage.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

"That campers, caravans and other trailers can be in their own parking space for ten days.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

When you were on the board.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"It may have nothing to do with it, but it has changed.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
A bit to your advantage.,approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0
"It has been changed to our advantage, that's right.",approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0
But it can only change by majority votes.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Mrs. Duijzer was not present at the meeting, so no vote cast.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Then I now take a look at those internal regulations, as it has changed.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
The most important thing is that it is forbidden to park motor vehicles on the site.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Unlike in the designated parking spaces.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"But for a short time elsewhere, if all parking bays are occupied.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That is about double parking.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"When people have a lot of visitors, all parking spaces are often full.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And then double parks.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
But that is not just because of us.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
It is also by other residents.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Only we get the complaints.,annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
Can I say something about that?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0

Do you also want to tell that clearly that you have done that?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0

We have been affected by the VVA.,annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0

We were going to change excess stuff on Marktplaats.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Well, we were not allowed to do that, because we caused nuisance.",annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0

"Well, the judge has shown.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We gave no nuisance.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

To park double.,annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
And the VVA doesn't do anything about that.,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
Is this about parking or about the entire VVA?,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
I would like that clear.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Because I have nothing to do with those whole scenes.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That's far before my time.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I came to live there in 2014.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We have received you with open arms in the first instance.,caring,mild,happiness,3,5,0

But leave us alone. I don't ask more.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
Good. Then I close the hearing.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

We also have to deal with rules.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

How is Master Visser going to reduce peace in the parking lot?,curiosity,moderate,happiness,3,7,1

According to the internal regulations ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
May only be parked within the parking bays.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And therefore not completely or partially outside.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"However, there are exceptions.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

As happens now.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Those are the rules, Mrs. Teunie.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
The same applies to the camper.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
It may not normally be placed outside the own parking space.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

"To load, unload and clean.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"This resolved the legal issue of parking, I think.",relief,mild,happiness,3,24,0

Mrs. Teunie has bitten herself in an injustice ...,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
that she apparently was affected years ago.,sadness,mild,sadness,5,26,0

From now on she only has to interfere with her own affairs.,disapproval,strong,disgust,1,10,2

They were afraid of you. No. Are there no hares yet?,amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
We just don't want to see you. Shall we just inside ...,disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
Chat a little further about it with a cup of coffee?,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Yes, please.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"How long do you live here now, Anneke? Since 2011.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And how was the contact with Gerda at the beginning?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Just a very nice neighbor. Also caring.,admiration,mild,happiness,3,0,0
We had a girlfriend group with cards and games and such.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Nice. And it was very nice.,joy,mild,happiness,3,17,0
You were just girlfriends? Yes. Certainly.,joy,mild,happiness,3,17,0
"And I just miss that. Yes, do you miss that?",sadness,mild,sadness,5,26,0
"Yes, of course. Because the girlfriend club no longer exists, I understand.",sadness,mild,sadness,5,26,0
No. And how did that happen?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Yes. Because of those zerren.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
Through the Zerren? Yes. Really and truly?,surprise,mild,surprise,6,27,0
Yes. And it went to me. So that's ...,disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
I don't have to nag.,annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
They give you the feeling that you are a big whining ...,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
I have two. Look.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"One, two. Ajoe.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And out.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We usually did not play people R here.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And I think it's a shame that it ended this way.,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
So ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I was very fermented.,anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
"How she deals with me, I think ...",disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
Yes. Look. That was it.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Because how long has the zerren been there?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Two years. Almost two years.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And how did that go?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Did they consult that with you in advance?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
There was a chat about the balcony.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And then she said of ... well, Anneke, I have a roof made.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And did you agree then? Or did you still ask?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"No, it was only communicated. And I thought ...",disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
"Oh, roof. It would be better than expected.",optimism,mild,happiness,3,21,0
And I think ... I see it.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
Yet it is there. Yes.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
How did that go? One day they started building.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Yes. Do you take me to that day?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Well, it took a week.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And I was all the way here on the Winden Drover.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I thought ... what is this? No roof is made at all.,confusion,moderate,surprise,6,6,1
You were eating in that beautiful chair?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Yes. Precisely.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I sit there and I see that there is a whole danger to.,fear,moderate,fear,2,14,1
"Well, I got so angry.",anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
And in the end there was such a workman on my balcony.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Then I said, you are gone. Yes, I was so frightened.",fear,strong,fear,2,14,2
"I have never been so angry in my life, really.",anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
"I've never experienced that, this, really.",surprise,strong,surprise,6,27,2
And then it was ready and then Gerda came to ring the bell.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And why, I still know that, but I was so angry now.",anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
"I say, I am not so happy with this, to be honest.",disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
"Well, six, if you are not with it, then you will sell your house.",disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
Then you have to sell your house.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
Did she say that?,surprise,moderate,surprise,6,27,1
"I just feel, eh, yes ...",confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
Whether it is all nothing to do with ...,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
Sounds a bit like the neighbor is a fairly spicy type.,disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
"You say so, I know for sure.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"It's, yes ... no, sorry, I'm not saying it. That's them.",disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
And you don't really dare to compete with that?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"And when I enter into discussion with her, I don't win.",disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
"And that is not about winning, but then ...",realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
"Yes, but that is a bit exemplary for how you are in the competition.",disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
You are just a bit afraid of the neighbor.,fear,mild,fear,2,14,0
She has walked you by foot. You don't feel heard.,sadness,moderate,sadness,5,26,1
And there is actually a bit of a kind of beaten dog opposite me.,sadness,moderate,sadness,5,26,1
You feel a Zompion.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
"A Zompion. It's like I'm not right ... or if I, eh ...",confusion,moderate,surprise,6,6,1
... very spicy.,amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
He will investigate the case very well. What is your requirement for him?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"I want the conservatory, if possible, so the conservatory will leave.",desire,moderate,happiness,3,8,1
"And if he can stand, the tras is cleaned once a year.",desire,mild,happiness,3,8,0
Now take it easy.,caring,mild,happiness,3,5,0
Is good. Yes? Okay. I'll come out.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Well, it's a very sad situation.",sadness,moderate,sadness,5,26,1
What strikes me is that Anneke has a lot of awe for her neighbor ...,admiration,mild,happiness,3,0,0
... and that she prefers to avoid confrontation.,fear,mild,fear,2,14,0
But what hurts her the most is that the same neighbor ...,sadness,moderate,sadness,5,26,1
... of which she thought it was a girlfriend ...,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
It seems to be a spicy lady. Gerda's Wil is law.,amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
Ah.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We will see that for a while.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Anyway, also curious about this side of the story, of course.",curiosity,moderate,happiness,3,7,1
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Victor. Gerda Vreeswijn.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Heard a lot about it.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"And Hans. And Hans, the friend.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I come and chat with you about the fight with the neighbor.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
About the conservatory. Okay.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And now I have already seen him there on the outside ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
... but I would really like to see him inside.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
That is possible. Yes? Shall we go that way right away?,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"He comes, Marino.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Oh, new.",surprise,mild,surprise,6,27,0
Imposing. JA.,admiration,moderate,happiness,3,0,1
Poepchic.,amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
Beautiful. Yes.,admiration,moderate,happiness,3,0,1
This is a bit of the Ferrari under the greenhouses.,admiration,moderate,happiness,3,0,1
Boy. I would like that.,desire,moderate,happiness,3,8,1
I think that's ... yes.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Have you researched whether you can build the conservatory ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
... as you built it?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
The contractor did that.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And it was allowed permit -free?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Yes. As she calls it. Yes, yes, yes.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Yes, I get it. Well, he's neat.",approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0
And I can imagine that you enjoy it a lot.,approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0
"But the neighbor says, I lost my view.",disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
"Yes, she still has a view.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"But she says, I used to look out to the farm there ...",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
... and now I feel locked up.,sadness,moderate,sadness,5,26,1
"If she stands at that renewing, she can still look at the farm.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
She also says she suffers from less sunlight.,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
She misses the sun terribly.,sadness,moderate,sadness,5,26,1
"She says, that really saves a sip on a drink.",disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
Now that that thing has become so high.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"If she took that sip of that drink, she might be happy.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
You will actually find the whining. Yes.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
That's it too. You can imagine that.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
She is never really satisfied.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
Not with her entire life either. She is not satisfied with her life.,sadness,moderate,sadness,5,26,1
And then you get problems.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
"If you don't get them, you will look for them.",disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
Did you like this plan to build this conservatory ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
... did you consult that with the neighbor then?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
When did you tell her that?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Well before we started building.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And what did that look like, that conversation?",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
That happened with drawings.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I made a whole drawing of that conservatory.,pride,mild,happiness,3,22,0
Do you mean that? Yes.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And he took Gerda to the neighbor.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
We played a game with four ladies.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
The girlfriend club. Correct.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And when I was once when it was here, I showed that drawing.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I was on the table. They could all view him.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
But the neighbor was one hundred percent for sure?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Certainly. But they just had no interest.,disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
She didn't really want to see the drawings.,disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
"Precisely. I am afraid of that too, yes.",fear,mild,fear,2,14,0
And what happened then?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Something crazy. The neighbor told me that she certainly ...,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
Drawings of the conservatory has shown.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Is it?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
I look in the blue viewers.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
I have never seen that drawing in advance.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
Then I don't know who is playing. Not me.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
Of course you could have tackled it differently.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
Of course you didn't have that girlfriend night ...,disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
But just being able to ask the neighbor for coffee.,desire,mild,happiness,3,8,0
"Being able to say, neighbor, sit down.",desire,mild,happiness,3,8,0
Because this could also have an impact on your terrace.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Why didn't you do that?,curiosity,moderate,happiness,3,7,1
It has always been a whiner in all conversations.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"She is always ... well, don't matter.",annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
Can I conclude that you thought then ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Do you know what, we will go our way with that conservatory ...",optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
"Because she doesn't like it, is it? Yes, I already knew that.",realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
Could that have played a role? Yes.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
"If she is 78, she will be in March ...",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Then she must know, among other things, that in life ...",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
That you don't prepare it with nagging and zaniks.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
I understood that you were really good friends.,surprise,mild,surprise,6,27,0
"Yes, well, you can.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
But if you get that she will do this ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Yes, did it really go wrong there? No, then with the construction.",confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
"Because the mechanic who walked here, he had to put that big plate in it ...",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And then he started scolding and raging against him.,anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
"Then I said to Gerda, if you go.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And then did you go there? Yes.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I have rang and she opens the door and ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
What are you doing to me?,confusion,moderate,surprise,6,6,1
He stood under cursing.,anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
"The Druids saw away in an insistent way. I think, wait a minute.",confusion,moderate,surprise,6,6,1
I can also walk and I will come behind you.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
So we walked into the room.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Then she said, I would like you to find the places dead here.",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Then I didn't say a word, no letter anymore.",sadness,mild,sadness,5,26,0
I turned around.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"I walked away and I think, you can see.",disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
"But I have been crying at home, you know.",sadness,strong,sadness,5,26,2
Really and truly? Yes.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"If someone wants you to die, that destroys a lot for me.",grief,strong,sadness,5,16,2
Then a book will also close.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
Dat was Anneke. Bye.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Then something else and I am a bit shocked.,surprise,mild,surprise,6,27,0
The neighbor said you said ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
that she can fall dead on the spot.,anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
You know that for sure? Yes.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
What did you say then?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
I said she was anti -social and underhanded.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
Antisocial and underhand. I didn't say she could fall to death.,disapproval,strong,disgust,1,10,2
Not either ... I knew in advance that it would happen.,realization,moderate,surprise,6,23,1
And why is this so upset you?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
That it is just not fair.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
I just didn't say it.,remorse,mild,sadness,5,25,0
"It's all for me, right?",confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
"And I notice on your side, what is she worried about?",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
What a surpite. That way you can do it.,surprise,mild,surprise,6,27,0
"What I suspect, what puts behind it ...",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Because I am here too.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Because you have a cozy guy?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Well, cozy. Yes, cozy.",approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0
A guy. But a handsome one.,admiration,mild,happiness,3,0,0
"I am there, I can say that way.",pride,mild,happiness,3,22,0
It's a sweetness.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"How nice they are. Look, they come and have a look.",joy,mild,happiness,3,17,0
They always feel that there is Russie somewhere.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
I think they ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"She is loose, as long as it can be.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And a bit stupid.,disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
Because what you destroy with your mouth ...,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
That will not be good anymore.,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
"That will no longer be fine, what she does that way.",disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
So the neighbor has the ice that it is broken off.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
"Oh, that's not nauseous.",surprise,mild,surprise,6,27,0
Do you also have a counter ice cream fishing?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
That she leaves for a retirement home.,sadness,mild,sadness,5,26,0
"I already notice it, you just want rest.",realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
"Yes, let them stop that whining and sucking and sucking.",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
He and I worked hard for it.,pride,moderate,happiness,3,22,1
That's how it is. We are going to sort it out to the bottom.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
I'll come and get you again when master fishing is on the way.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Brace yourself, I'll come out.",optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
Enjoy the view.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"I have to say, I personally think it is a bit of a sad thing today.",sadness,mild,sadness,5,26,0
Between two neighbors who used to be very cozy in a girlfriend club ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And played all kinds of games.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And nowadays only a game of bullying is played, but not otherwise.",disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
We can say that it did not go very well around that conservatory in communication.,disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
Gerda and Hans thought they had land and that they wanted to build a conservatory.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And we really just do not discuss that with the neighbor, because he always nags.",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"And Anneke, in turn, saw it all happening, but he thought, let's not say anything about it.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Because otherwise I get into a fight.,fear,mild,fear,2,14,0
And so we now have the fried pears.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"I am happy that Master Visser is on the road, who has hired his regular building expert.",joy,mild,happiness,3,17,0
"I have agreed with both ladies and of course Hans, outside on the street, overlooking the conservatory.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

Sure. Hello.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"If you take a small step to that side, the neighbors will come on this side.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Are we still greeting each other?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Not just.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"After she has desired me, I didn't look them up anymore, so then I don't do it now.",disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
Isn't that actually quite a shame?,disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
"Yes, I think it's a shame too.",disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
Early joint did you play games together?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Yes, wine. Great.",amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
But that is not all anymore? No.,sadness,mild,sadness,5,26,0
"Anneke, you say, there is no consultation with me about that conservatory.",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"And, niks.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
You have a different story.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
"Once we went to play games, I was on the table.",amusement,mild,happiness,3,1,0
I explained what it was going to be and then you may not have listened.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"If you say to me on the balcony, I am going to make a roof and I will be the conservatory.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Well, sorry.",remorse,mild,sadness,5,25,0
"Anneke says, there has been a conversation about the fence on the terrace.",confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
Never. I never had a conversation with her about the fence.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"Well, then I should have stood on the stairs.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"I get up quite a bit, then you're not crazy, right?",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"The neighbors think, Anneke can't make me anything.",disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
I have that conservatory and she has to keep her mouth shut.,anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
"At one point, Anneke, a technician was on the railing.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Yes, too. You found that very annoying.",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
Yes. Then you went to the door.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Yes. What was said then?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
I asked Anneke if that boy could stand on the thing to turn in one screw.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"Well, then she ran screaming and walked away.",fear,strong,fear,2,14,2
I don't remember what she said.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
Then you went into the room.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
"And then I asked, why is that not allowed?",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"And nothing of it, and you just do it.",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"Yes, is that or not?",confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
You can die on the spot.,fear,strong,fear,2,14,2
You said that.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Is it?,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
I think it's terrible that I am called a liar.,anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
I said you were underhanded.,anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
You prefer to say you bakst.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
"Well, I'm leaving. I am now ...",annoyance,strong,anger,0,3,2
"Anneke, stay there, because we have to go through that sour apple.",optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
But for that we are here.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
I just saw that it would happen that way.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
"Calm, quiet, quiet.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Then you shouldn't lie.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
"No, you are.",annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
"Anneke, this touches you enormously because you say ...",caring,moderate,happiness,3,5,1
I would never say that.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
"Anyway, if you have thought that maybe, you can.",curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Jesus Christ.,surprise,moderate,surprise,6,27,1
"Yes, Jesus Christ.",surprise,moderate,surprise,6,27,1
Put them in my shoes.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

I take off my shoes and I walk on it longer.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,21,1
I actually knew in advance how she would respond.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
That's how I know her from here.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
Then there is something that you think it might play a role.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
And that is jealousy.,realization,moderate,surprise,6,23,1
Because she sees that I might have a new friend.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Well, I would have liked it if she had suggested something when she got a friend.",disappointment,mild,sadness,5,9,0
I haven't seen either.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

I felt that there was a small cover or something.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
I felt that you became a little more casual.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
And then I noticed this morning that we really had to start again.,realization,mild,surprise,6,23,0
And then I wanted to make the best of it again.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0
And at some point the conversations were also fluent again.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,20,0

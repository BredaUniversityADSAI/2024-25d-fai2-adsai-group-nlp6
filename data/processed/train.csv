Tonight the shocking sequel to last week's broadcast.,excitement,moderate,happiness,3,13,1
Because in our research into waste coaches on the so-called pro-ana sites ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
... we will track a life -threatening man who has to go behind bars as quickly as possible.,optimism,strong,happiness,3,20,2
We set up a fall for this man who really exceeds all boundaries.,optimism,strong,happiness,3,20,2
He wants to have a girl with anorexia completely in his power and humiliate.,disgust,strong,disgust,1,11,2
"You carry out all my assignments. If you don't, you get punishment.",anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
He has booked a hotel room and wants sex with the child there.,disgust,strong,disgust,1,11,2
We catch the waste coach for a hot act and I intervene.,optimism,strong,happiness,3,20,2
"You are a so-called pro-ana coach, right?",disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
You think you can meet up with a 15-year-old girl.,disapproval,strong,disgust,1,10,2
The confrontation is given a very special turn.,surprise,moderate,surprise,6,26,1
"What kind of insane madman are you, man, that you want to do this with young girls?",anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
That and more tonight in Undercover in the Netherlands.,excitement,moderate,happiness,3,13,1
We are researching one of the darkest worlds in which we were ever undercover.,fear,strong,fear,2,14,2
The world of pro-ana and its self-proclaimed waste coaches ...,disgust,strong,disgust,1,11,2
who abuse young anorexia patients in a terrible way.,anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
We want those practices to come to an end once and for all.,optimism,strong,happiness,3,20,2
"Unfortunately, research is also needed into the waste coach from last week's broadcast.",disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
Because there is all rise.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
"This coach, who calls himself coach and master, agreed with my colleague ...",disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
who played a 15-year anorexia patient.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
I hardly dare to go to the car anymore.,fear,moderate,fear,2,14,1
I find it a bit exciting.,nervousness,mild,fear,2,18,0
She had to follow a life -threatening waste plan from him.,fear,strong,fear,2,14,2
Have you looked at what it means if this is done by someone in practice?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
And what does that mean?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
You can die.,fear,strong,fear,2,14,2
You can die of it?,fear,strong,fear,2,14,2
And then you send this?,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
And you send this to a 15 -year -old girl?,disgust,strong,disgust,1,11,2
He confessed to have sent a masturbation film to her ...,disgust,strong,disgust,1,11,2
And wanted sex with the girl.,disgust,strong,disgust,1,11,2
I called the police on the spot and he was stopped.,relief,moderate,happiness,3,23,1

I cut it.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
You are cutting down?,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
I promise him.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
Tonight you can see that the promise turned out not to be worth anything.,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
"Because the police had his identity, on his phone ...",neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
Was now familiar with all the facts and could start an investigation.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
But the waste coach was allowed to drive away after that standing position.,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
And this happened that afternoon immediately afterwards.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
"When we drive away, we drive past the waste coach.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
And then my soundman stands out.,surprise,mild,surprise,6,26,0

Did you understand that you were not taken by the police?,confusion,moderate,surprise,6,6,1
Nee.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0

"No, not me either. You're crazy, right?",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"No, I don't get it either, but it is not different, is it?",confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
Would you like to be taken away?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"Well, rather not, but ...",nervousness,mild,fear,2,18,0
"But yes, you will get an investigation of your pants of course, isn't it?",nervousness,moderate,fear,2,18,1
"Yes, well, that's no different.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
"But, I say that Alberto.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
I'm not going to do this anymore.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,20,1
Do you please ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
... go to one of those sites to look at that Bandernerman?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
It is dangerous.,fear,moderate,fear,2,14,1
He is talking about another waste coach ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
... who is really bad according to him.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
I can tell you ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
... that of course we have been working on research into anything and everything ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
... but the most important thing is ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
"Yes, he is the coach from the world half. I understand that.",realization,mild,surprise,6,22,0

I understand.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
You are going to participate in the police investigation?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Anyway.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
And you are going to stop?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
And.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
I really hope this is on cabbage for a week.,annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
"That you never, when never, do this again.",disapproval,strong,disgust,1,10,2
Ask me.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
"Well, I promise.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
"And I say that, I promise.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
I come to have my promise after.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
"Yes, but that promise doesn't tell me anything.",disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
"Soon the police will be back, in front of the door.",fear,moderate,fear,2,14,1
You are going to pay.,anger,strong,anger,0,2,2
"Yes, dat anyway.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
That anyway.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
And then he drove away.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
But what he didn't know is that we have followed him.,surprise,mild,surprise,6,26,0
And that's a good thing too.,approval,mild,happiness,3,4,0
Because his promise to stop indeed did not mean anything.,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
Because despite the standing attitude by the police ...,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
... he continues with his malicious practices.,disgust,strong,disgust,1,11,2
It is a few days after the confrontation.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
If this waste coach makes contact with one of our profiles ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
... that we had already created.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
In addition to the profile of a 15-year-old girl ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
... I also stood with another profile of a 16-year-old girl with an AID disorder ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
...met hem in contact.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
And now he seeks rapprochement with that girl.,disgust,moderate,disgust,1,11,1
With the story he has to stop coaching ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
... because he would have been listed by me.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
After trying to get pity because he is scaled up at the pillory ...,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
... he continues with his filthy practices.,disgust,strong,disgust,1,11,2
He wants this 16-year-old girl to send a live photo.,disgust,strong,disgust,1,11,2
So that she proves him that she is real and not from our program.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"She sends that photo, but then he wants one in bra.",disgust,strong,disgust,1,11,2
And then he asks for a topless photo several times.,disgust,strong,disgust,1,11,2
It is incredible but true.,surprise,moderate,surprise,6,26,1
But despite the current police investigation ...,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
... So this man just continues with his horrible practices.,disgust,strong,disgust,1,11,2
You would think he would never do this again after the last time.,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
But the opposite is therefore the case.,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
Off to confrontation number 2.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,20,1
We now know where he works.,realization,mild,surprise,6,22,0
And a colleague keeps an eye on the parking lot there.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
The advantage now compared to the previous time is of course ...,optimism,mild,happiness,3,20,0
... that we know which car he drives and know what he looks like.,realization,mild,surprise,6,22,0
So he won't escape us.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,20,1
And then he just keeps driving until you are almost at the back.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
"O, Games Sta is al.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
"If you look through your left, you will see the car here.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
I'm just going to do it that way.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
And it is important that we are not seen by others.,nervousness,moderate,fear,2,18,1
A gentleman runs behind us.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
"No, that's another boy.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
Are you sure?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Here the light comes out of this office.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
A man is coming. Is that him?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Is that to him? Yes.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
"So, there we are again.",annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0

Ask? To whom?,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
To a girl for a topless photo? Who?,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
You? To whom?,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
To a girl? Ask me ...,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
"Seriously, to whom?",curiosity,moderate,happiness,3,7,1
You have chatted with me. Instead of...,disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0

This is you. With her.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
You have been that.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
In fact ... I have not been.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
"In fact, you say it yourself.",realization,mild,surprise,6,22,0
That we may be from the television station.,realization,mild,surprise,6,22,0
I was tired of a TV presenter there.,annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
I have not been that.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0

"Stop it, man. Serious.",annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
"You lie that you are bursting, man.",anger,moderate,anger,0,2,1

With the same account.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
"Yes, you are there again, boy.",annoyance,mild,anger,0,3,0
I really get so tired of this.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
It only makes me tired.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
You are an incredible dirt.,disgust,strong,disgust,1,11,2
I want to cut it down.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,20,1
I deleted my account.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
This was a day later.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
Did you continue a day later or not?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
And I deleted my account.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
Can I go home or not?,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
You continued after this confrontation.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
I have her ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
You promised that you would stop.,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
Then you are crazy man.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
I said I was going to stop or not?,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
You have asked her for a topless photo.,disapproval,strong,disgust,1,10,2
I told her that I was going to stop.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
But you also said ...,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
I said I was going to stop.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
He keeps calling that.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
He didn't stop at all.,disappointment,moderate,sadness,5,9,1
And then he thinks he can scare me.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
Shall I go to court?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Very happy.,joy,strong,happiness,3,17,2
To drag me to court ...,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
I hope so.,optimism,mild,happiness,3,20,0
Because this deserves ...,approval,moderate,happiness,3,4,1

Can we cut down?,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
"No, we are not going to cut down anything.",disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
I will continue to follow you.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,20,1
You will continue to do this.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
After this confrontation.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
You ask a girl for a topless photo.,disapproval,strong,disgust,1,10,2
"That was a week earlier, but it doesn't matter.",neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
Not true.,disapproval,mild,disgust,1,10,0
You said you are off the TV.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
And then there was a conversation.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
Can I see your photo? A live photo.,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
We sent that.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
And then you ask ...,curiosity,mild,happiness,3,7,0
Can I have one in bra?,desire,moderate,happiness,3,8,1
And then ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
I don't trust it.,disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
Girls sending a topless photo ...,disapproval,strong,disgust,1,10,2
Then I know for sure that you are not off the TV.,realization,moderate,surprise,6,22,1
This is how the conversation went.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
And again he admits ...,realization,mild,surprise,6,22,0
That he has denied earlier.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
Why do you say that you are not?,confusion,moderate,surprise,6,6,1
I thought it was a week earlier.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
So often you do this.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
Why did you just say that you had not sent this?,confusion,moderate,surprise,6,6,1
It was after the confrontation.,realization,mild,surprise,6,22,0
I thought it was before.,confusion,mild,surprise,6,6,0
Do you know how important that is?,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
So you continue.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
After that confrontation you just continued.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
But after that confrontation you continued.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
And these prove ...,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0
Will also end up with the police.,optimism,moderate,happiness,3,20,1
You don't stop.,annoyance,moderate,anger,0,3,1
That is clear to me.,realization,mild,surprise,6,22,0
"That was already clear to me, because I didn't believe you.",disapproval,moderate,disgust,1,10,1
Then the man suddenly throws his phone.,surprise,moderate,surprise,6,26,1
"Fortunately, the police have already investigated his phone.",relief,mild,happiness,3,23,0
And we have naturally saved all his chats.,neutral,mild,neutral,4,19,0

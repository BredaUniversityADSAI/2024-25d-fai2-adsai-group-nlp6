00:00:00,00:00:04,Inside this box is the smallest computer cluster I've ever seen.,happiness,curiosity,mild
00:00:04,00:00:09,"And it gets all the power it needs through one network cable, at least if it actually works.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:00:09,00:00:12,This is a prototype of Sipeed's nanocluster.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:00:12,00:00:16,It promises to hold up to 7 Raspberry PI compute modules.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:00:16,00:00:22,"These things, each of these can have up to 16 gigabytes of RAM and a quad core ARM CPU.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:00:22,00:00:30,"That means this little thing could hold over 100 gigs of RAM and 28 cores of CPU power, all in the size of a coffee mug.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:00:30,00:00:36,"Through the magic of editing, you might be seeing some B roll of this thing running, but I don't even know if it'll work yet.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:00:36,00:00:39,So let's get it out of its box and build a PI cluster.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:00:40,00:00:47,So I'm going to tell you about everything I see in this box and just let you know that of course Sipeed sent this to me.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:00:47,00:00:48,I did not pay for this.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:00:48,00:00:54,"And I will be buying one of these when they're for sale, but they're on presale right now, so pre sale is always weird.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:00:55,00:01:04,"I'm not going to go deep into the pricing, only to say that Sipeed usually makes things that are a lot cheaper, sometimes without as many features as other products that you could compare it to.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:01:05,00:01:09,"But this is, I think, starting around 40 or 50 bucks for the base model.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:01:09,00:01:16,"And then you add on things like POE power and other stuff, and it can get up to 100 to 200 bucks, depending on where you live.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:01:16,00:01:22,Because in the US we have our wonderful tariffs and also depending on the different options that you choose.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:01:23,00:01:25,So they sent me pretty much everything this comes with.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:01:25,00:01:36,"In the top here, there's this little USB to UART adapter that I think can get four modules UART into the USB of the first module that you install in here.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:01:36,00:01:38,I don't think I'll set this up yet.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:01:38,00:01:41,I will set that up later once I get everything else going.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:01:41,00:01:49,"But they also include again, 65 watt USB C power supply and USB C power cable, which I'm not going to use right now.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:01:49,00:01:51,I'm going to try to use POE power.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:01:51,00:01:55,So we're going to set that aside right now and we're going to get right into here.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:01:55,00:01:58,And it has a quick start guide printed right on the top.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:01:58,00:02:06,It says visit Wiki Sipede nanocluster before use and it has a few notes about the different ways that you can use this.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:02:06,00:02:11,"Being such a small device, it looks like these are the compute module adapters.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:02:11,00:02:17,"Being such a small device, cooling and power are two Very important issues to take into account.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:02:17,00:02:23,"So you can even see on the bottom, they have a heat sink down here and some airflow to cool the bottom of their board.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:02:23,00:02:31,"And then on the top here, they have this POE power module that plugs into the board and it's all put together using some 3D printed inserts.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:02:31,00:02:34,So I'm sure there's going to be a way that you could 3D print your own case for this thing as well.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:02:35,00:02:39,But let's take a look at this device before we get into the other goodies that they sent along.,happiness,curiosity,mild
00:02:39,00:02:45,"This is a 7 node cluster, and it looks like it's using M2 slots, which is interesting.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:02:46,00:02:53,So there's got to be some adapter boards that goes from the dual M2 slots to a compute module riser.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:02:53,00:02:57,"And then there's LEDs over here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1 for each slot.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:02:57,00:03:02,These are the pins for that UART adapter that gets you serial console access to all of these.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:03:03,00:03:07,"And then on the back here, there's two USB 2.0 ports, it looks like.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:03:07,00:03:10,I don't know if you can get USB 3.0 out of that.,happiness,curiosity,mild
00:03:10,00:03:14,There's USB C power input that takes 65 watts PD.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:03:14,00:03:16,There's a network cable.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:03:16,00:03:18,This is a 1 gigabit LAN connection.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:03:18,00:03:24,"And what's interesting is under here, I'm not going to take it apart right now because I want to make sure it actually works.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:03:24,00:03:28,Under here there's a RISC V network switch that's managed.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:03:28,00:03:35,"So from any node on here, you can actually manage this network switch and set up VLANs for your raspberry PIs.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:03:35,00:03:38,You can set whether the ports are active or not active.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:03:39,00:03:45,"And there's a very lightweight BMC for power, so that from this slot you can turn on or off all the other slots as well.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:03:46,00:03:51,I think there are some caveats with different models of compute module that you might use on here.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:03:51,00:03:53,Check the wiki for all those instructions.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:03:53,00:03:56,There's also an HDMI port that connects to slot one.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:03:56,00:04:02,So slot one is kind of like the node that takes over everything else and can control everything on here.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:04:02,00:04:08,"Then there's a fan header that goes to this fan, which is a pretty beefy fan, and it might be a little bit loud.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:04:08,00:04:08,We'll see.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:04:08,00:04:15,"But it also is good to have good cooling, especially when you have a big POE module here kind of blocking the exit airflow.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:04:15,00:04:21,"But this is meant to run in open air, so it'll blow the air in and exhaust it out the top like that.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:04:21,00:04:23,And that should hopefully work okay.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:04:23,00:04:28,But we're going to see they also included these three little guys.,happiness,curiosity,mild
00:04:28,00:04:30,So let me get my scissors.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:04:31,00:04:34,These are LM3H modules.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:04:35,00:04:42,So the way that this works is it's basically two M2 modules side by side and they have an open source repository that has the.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:04:42,00:04:44,The pin outs and everything in it.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:04:44,00:04:53,"So you could build your own carrier boards or if you're building your own system on module like this, where the whole computer is on the module, you could build your own SOM and put it into here.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:04:54,00:04:58,But it looks like these just plug in like this and that's it.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:04:58,00:04:59,And these are.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:04:59,00:05:06,"These are very low power, smaller computers, but they also don't require as much cooling, so you can have the cooling run a little bit lighter.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:05:07,00:05:13,And these also don't have the ability to have M2NVME SSDs on them or anything like that.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:05:13,00:05:14,They have a lot less I o.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:05:14,00:05:17,They have 100 megabit networking instead of gigabit.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:05:17,00:05:19,So I'm not going to test this right now.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:05:19,00:05:20,I'll test this.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:05:21,00:05:26,I'll probably put it up on my SBC reviews repository and that website.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:05:26,00:05:26,So feel free to.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:05:26,00:05:34,"If you want to see how this runs with the H618 chip from Allwinner, I'll test it later and I'll put those results up on that website.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:05:35,00:05:40,"But for today, I'm going to take these out and we're going to focus on the Raspberry PI Compute Module 5s.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:05:40,00:05:46,"It looks like they have seven adapters, so I could put up to seven Compute Module 5s in here.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:05:47,00:05:48,Let's see how these are sitting in here.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:05:48,00:05:50,So they have a little piece of foam holding all these together?,fear,nervousness,mild
00:05:51,00:05:51,"Actually, yeah.",happiness,admiration,mild
00:05:51,00:05:57,There's seven of these and each of these little carrier boards with the foam that's a little flaky.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:05:57,00:06:01,I'm gonna take these out of here and get this foam out of here so it doesn't flake all over the place.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:06:01,00:06:02,Okay.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:06:02,00:06:06,"So each of these little carrier boards, this is the one for the compute module 4 and 5.",happiness,admiration,mild
00:06:06,00:06:09,And you plug your compute module 5 into the top side here.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:06:09,00:06:12,And then it looks like there's a USB C port.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:06:12,00:06:24,I'm not sure if that's for UART or power or what it might be for like USB3 from the module and that'd be really cool because then you could plug in USB devices and then there's an NVME SSD slot.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:06:24,00:06:26,They didn't include any screws.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:06:26,00:06:30,So I'll have to go dig around and find some M2 screws to test this.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:06:30,00:06:34,But I'm actually not going to test the M2 slot today for a reason.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:06:34,00:06:35,I'll get into it in a little bit.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:06:35,00:06:38,The board works with any type of compute module.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:06:38,00:06:51,"Whether you have emmc, where there's a chip on the back here that has all the storage on it, or if you have a light compute module like this one that doesn't have that chip, you can use either micro SD cards or an NVME SSD to boot it.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:06:51,00:06:57,Or of course you can always network boot a Raspberry PI if you have your NAS set up appropriately.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:06:57,00:07:05,But let's get these plugged in and get them into the module carrier and we'll see if we can boot this thing up with POE power.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:07:05,00:07:14,"So the first six of these are EMMC modules, which means I plugged them into my computer over there and I used Raspberry PI Imager to flash them.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:07:14,00:07:17,"But anyway, let's get these all set up and I'm going to have.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:07:17,00:07:22,"I already named these cluster 1, cluster 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:07:22,00:07:26,And so I'm going to put this number one into the first slot.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:07:27,00:07:28,It looks like you just push down.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:07:29,00:07:36,These little PCBs are a little bit thin because they're M2 size and they fit into the M2 slot.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:07:36,00:07:37,So just keep that in mind.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:07:37,00:07:41,They're a little bit more fragile than I'm used to with some other carrier board designs.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:07:41,00:07:43,But let's get these all plugged in.,happiness,curiosity,mild
00:07:47,00:07:53,I just realized that my alpha version of The Compute Module 5 has its little UART debug port sticking out here.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:07:53,00:07:58,"So I'm gonna put this number six into the seven slot, which is gonna confuse me later on, but that's okay.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:07:59,00:08:03,So I'm not going to install number seven and I'm gonna tell you why.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:08:03,00:08:15,"I was reading through the wiki Sipedes Wiki for this thing and, and it mentions if you're going to use POE power, that's this thing, it gives you 60 watts with Poe, I believe.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:08:15,00:08:24,"And if you only have 60 watts of power, it's a little risky using NVME drives because they each use 1 to 3 watts, sometimes even more than that.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:08:24,00:08:27,And that can go over your power budget and cause instability.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:08:28,00:08:37,"So if you're using all NVME drives, they actually recommend you use like four of these instead of seven and have a little space between them for cooling and for power, especially when you're using Poe.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:08:37,00:08:44,"There's also some different rules about whether you're using CM5s or CM4s or these little teeny tiny ones, the LM3h's.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:08:45,00:08:47,So read the wiki for all of that.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:08:47,00:08:53,"And today I'm just going to stick with the six of these, which should fit within the power budget of this guy.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:08:53,00:08:53,Which is.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:08:53,00:08:59,This is a poe charger with 56 volts at 0.535amps.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:08:59,00:09:00,I hope this is the right one.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:09:00,00:09:06,I have it labeled in the box as 802.3B +T which is 60 watts.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:09:06,00:09:07,So we'll see.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:09:08,00:09:17,"I got my network cable, I'm going to plug into the output on my POE device and we're going to plug this in and see what happens.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:09:18,00:09:20,"Now remember, I pre flashed these so they should all boot up.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:09:21,00:09:24,Assuming that this just doesn't just catch on fire in front of me.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:09:24,00:09:26,But hopefully that doesn't happen.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:09:29,00:09:30,There it goes.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:09:31,00:09:32,It's not the quietest in the world.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:09:32,00:09:40,"I think with the CM5s and CM4s it actually runs the fan at 100 just to be safe, but you can control the fan speeds.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:09:41,00:09:47,But so far everything's looking good and I'm going to see if I can see these on the network.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:09:48,00:09:54,I did indeed see them on the network and the main questions I had when I originally saw this cluster were around power and cooling.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:09:54,00:10:03,"To cram in that many computers in that small space, you have to supply enough power and cooling to make sure they don't just immediately throttle or shut down.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:10:03,00:10:06,I pushed it to the limit with 6cm5s.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:10:06,00:10:08,So how did the nano cluster do?,fear,nervousness,mild
00:10:08,00:10:10,So the power limits are real.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:10:10,00:10:20,This is hitting 60 watts with 6 compute module 5s running the StressNG matrix 0 which runs stress on all CPU cores.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:10:20,00:10:25,I'm running that indefinitely and that's enough to make it so that I can't even reach some of the PIs.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:10:25,00:10:31,"The other thing I noticed was when I just ran it on five of them, it was still getting up there and they were reachable.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:10:31,00:10:36,"But when, when it was in the heat of it, it was hitting throttling limits.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:10:36,00:10:37,So you can see it throttled here.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:10:38,00:10:46,"So if you're gonna run compute module 5s, you probably should heed the warnings from Sipeed and run maybe four of them or maybe five of them.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:10:46,00:10:51,Six of them I think is pushing it a little too far even with the USB C power supply.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:10:52,00:10:58,"Also something interesting I noticed when, when I'm just running these at idle, it goes down to 0.2 watts.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:10:58,00:11:01,And I think that there's like a weird power factor thing with.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:11:01,00:11:03,I'm just Going to cut myself off here.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:11:03,00:11:09,"I had never seen this kind of behavior before, and I assumed maybe the GAN charger was doing something weird with my power measurements.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:11:09,00:11:12,"But no, I actually discovered another feature of this board.",happiness,admiration,mild
00:11:12,00:11:13,Redundant power supplies.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:11:13,00:11:18,"If you have POE and USB C plugged in at the same time, it'll fail over between the two.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:11:18,00:11:26,"And in my case, my other network cable was plugged into this other POE switch, but that switch is only giving like 30 watts max over poe plus.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:11:26,00:11:34,"And because of that, when the board needed more power than that, it automatically switched over to USB C, which was supplying the full 65 watts.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:11:34,00:11:41,"I've also noticed that after I shut these down, I have to reseat them if I bring back board power.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:11:41,00:11:50,So I think there's a power issue with something in the firmware on maybe these carrier boards or something that causes that to happen.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:11:50,00:11:52,That's probably something I can fix in firmware.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:11:52,00:11:55,They said that CM4s also have some issues with that sometimes.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:11:55,00:12:01,"So another thing to keep in mind, this is idle with POE power 22 watts.",happiness,admiration,mild
00:12:02,00:12:14,"So running stress NG on all six PIs, I'm actually using more than 60 watts, 67.9 watts through this POE injector, which is rated for 60 watts.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:12:14,00:12:17,"But over here, how are the temperatures on the PIs doing?",happiness,admiration,mild
00:12:18,00:12:19,"Actually, not bad.",fear,nervousness,mild
00:12:20,00:12:22,I think that it actually stopped running the command though.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:12:22,00:12:23,Let's do that again.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:12:23,00:12:26,"Okay, they're getting warmer, but not overheating.",fear,nervousness,mild
00:12:27,00:12:28,Let's see if they're throttling.,happiness,curiosity,mild
00:12:31,00:12:38,"So it looks like we did get a little throttling earlier, but they're not currently throttling and they're getting hot though.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:12:38,00:12:48,"So I think with the density, you probably want to do four compute module 5s, not six of them like I have running right now and shut down completely.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:12:48,00:12:54,We are at 8 watts using poe and through the fun process of power.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:12:54,00:12:56,"Oh, I should get my hand a little bit away from that.",happiness,admiration,mild
00:12:56,00:13:05,"Through the process of powering this on and off a bunch of times, I've noticed that if you don't power it down for more than about eight or 10 seconds, some of the slots won't come back up.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:13:05,00:13:10,I think that it's like there must be something in the little BMC on this board that remembers things.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:13:10,00:13:14,"If you don't leave it powered off long enough, maybe there's a capacitor holding some charge in there.",happiness,curiosity,mild
00:13:15,00:13:21,"So if you're powering off the whole system to reboot all the boards, make sure you do it for 8 or 10 seconds.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:13:21,00:13:24,I guess it's been Consistent.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:13:24,00:13:29,"So there must be something that's holding a little power in there, some little memory that keeps it booted.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:13:29,00:13:31,But now I can reliably boot.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:13:31,00:13:34,"Okay, I need to be careful with where my finger is here.",happiness,admiration,mild
00:13:34,00:13:35,I need to.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:13:35,00:13:44,"I need to do some more testing with USB C, but I think I have a pretty reliable setup with Poe and it can run 6cm 5s.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:13:44,00:13:45,I would stick to 5.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:13:45,00:13:47,I will keep doing my power testing.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:13:48,00:13:48,Yes.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:13:49,00:13:52,And not sticking my finger inside that fan blade because it's running very fast.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:13:52,00:13:57,So just running stressng on that was on the Ethernet with the POE injector.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:13:57,00:13:59,And this is on USB C.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:13:59,00:14:02,USB C is using less power because the power supply is a little bit more efficient.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:14:03,00:14:05,But both of them throttled in the end.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:14:05,00:14:10,"You can see here that this was at the end peak, a couple of PIs were hitting 85 degrees.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:14:10,00:14:18,"So Sipeed says, you know, if you're going to be running a lot of high power stuff, you want to space out 4 PIs instead of having them crammed in so tightly.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:14:18,00:14:21,And that's probably some good advice.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:14:21,00:14:22,So that's it for power.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:14:22,00:14:24,"Next up, I wanted to dig into that fan.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:14:24,00:14:30,It's a bit loud and we can already see the PIs were throttling without enough airflow between them.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:14:30,00:14:35,I wanted to see if I could control the fan and also how thermals and sound levels were a little more quantitatively.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:14:36,00:14:44,"So next up, I was going to mess with the fan speeds because by default I'm going to be quiet for a second so you can see how loud it is without me yapping away.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:14:48,00:14:52,You can see it's about 58 decibels from 6 inches or whatever.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:14:52,00:14:54,It's definitely noticeable.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:14:54,00:15:00,I'll let you listen to it for a second without me talking close up so you can hear kind of the sound that you're going to hear.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:15:03,00:15:04,And it's not a horrible sound.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:15:04,00:15:07,It's not like a little whining bee or anything.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:15:07,00:15:09,But it's definitely not quiet.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:15:09,00:15:18,And what I was going to do is try to get it to be as quiet as I could get it without throttling the PIs under normal workloads.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:15:18,00:15:24,"However, the script that they provided, this script right here for the CM5, didn't seem to work.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:15:24,00:15:26,It wasn't changing the fan speed.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:15:26,00:15:31,So I have an email out to Sipeed to see if it's probably a pebc.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:15:31,00:15:34,The problem exists between the keyboard and the chair.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:15:34,00:15:46,"So anyway, they do provide instructions for their modules as well as CM4s and CM5s and I followed these instructions and it didn't quite work, but like I said, usually it's a pebcak.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:15:46,00:15:50,Sipee did respond with some better instructions and they're updating their wiki right now.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:15:50,00:16:00,"That's all well and good, but I did want to get questions from all of you, so I posted on Twitter bluesky, mastodon, YouTube threads.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:16:01,00:16:08,"It'd be nice if we went back to the old days when there was just one social media microblogging site, but now there's like 25 of them.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:16:08,00:16:13,"Anyway, I posted that to all those sites and asked, you know, what do you want to know?",happiness,admiration,mild
00:16:13,00:16:16,And here's some of the most common questions that I heard.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:16:16,00:16:18,"First, is the switch a managed switch?",happiness,admiration,mild
00:16:19,00:16:22,"Yes, though right now everything is in Chinese.",fear,nervousness,mild
00:16:22,00:16:27,Luckily Safari can translate things on the fly so I can at least see most of the information what it's doing.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:16:29,00:16:36,And I think that they're going to hopefully update that RISC V switch firmware at some point so that it's available in more languages.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:16:37,00:16:41,"And also the first time I tried loading it in Safari, it didn't actually load it as a white screen.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:16:41,00:16:44,I had to refresh a couple times so hopefully I'll get those bugs worked out.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:16:45,00:16:46,How much power does it use?,fear,nervousness,mild
00:16:46,00:16:51,"I showed some of that in this video already, but just to give some numbers that idle all slots powered off.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:16:51,00:17:02,"Poe was 8 watts, USB C was 6 watts idle with 6 CM5s booted, Poe was 22 watts, USB C was 19 watts, but that went up and down a little bit over time.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:17:03,00:17:09,"Maximum with 6cm5s running stress NG, Poe was pulling 68 watts or so.",happiness,admiration,mild
00:17:09,00:17:14,That was again with the power losses inherent in the actual adapter.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:17:14,00:17:19,"Same thing with the USB C, but it was pulling 60.8 watts with that same stress NG test.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:17:19,00:17:29,"How fast is networking all all the PIs were giving me a full gigabit individually, but that's of course bottlenecked quite a bit because there's just a 1 gigabit uplink.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:17:29,00:17:33,"So you know, if you need a lot of network bandwidth, this is not the board for you.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:17:33,00:17:36,Can you run K3s or Kubernetes on it?,fear,nervousness,mild
00:17:36,00:17:36,Yes.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:17:36,00:17:43,In fact I ran my PI cluster Ansible Playbook and it installed Kubernetes with a Drupal web app running inside of it.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:17:43,00:17:45,I can monitor the cluster with K9s.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:17:45,00:17:47,I could see all the stats in Grafana dashboards.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:17:48,00:17:51,Everything in there ran just fine like any other PI cluster I've set up.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:17:51,00:17:52,How fast is it?,fear,nervousness,mild
00:17:52,00:17:57,"Well, running my HPL clustering benchmark, I got 112 gigaflops.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:17:57,00:18:01,"That's actually faster than a single M2 MacBook Air, at least the base model.",happiness,admiration,mild
00:18:01,00:18:04,And it's faster than two N100 mini PCs put together.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:18:05,00:18:07,But I have to add some caveats here.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:18:07,00:18:14,"First, I was running the four gig models and only four of them because that was the most stable configuration I could run with the power and thermal limits.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:18:15,00:18:22,"I could get more performance with 16 gig CM5s, but then the cluster would go from like 500 bucks all in to over $1,000.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:18:22,00:18:26,"Second, whether you can see that performance gain really depends on what you're running.",happiness,admiration,mild
00:18:26,00:18:33,"This thing doesn't just glue all the CPUs together, you have to run distributed software or have stuff running separately in each slot like blade servers.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:18:33,00:18:36,"Finally, Apple still takes the efficiency crown.",happiness,admiration,mild
00:18:36,00:18:42,"The PI isn't terrible, but it's really on the low end of ARM efficiency compared to like Apple and Rockchip.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:18:42,00:18:45,"It's more efficient than intel, but only a little.",happiness,admiration,mild
00:18:45,00:18:48,I mean intel is a kind of a low bar to clear there.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:18:48,00:18:56,I also ran distributed LLAMA on it and I could get 17 or so tokens per second with a small model using about 40 watts of power for four nodes.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:18:56,00:19:02,"It's not slow, but it's not a speed champ either compared to just like running a single computer with a GPU.",happiness,curiosity,mild
00:19:02,00:19:09,But what's cool is for 500 bucks you can have a learning platform for things like distributed LLMs or HPC high performance computing.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:19:10,00:19:13,And that's I think where the niche is that this thing might make the most sense.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:19:13,00:19:17,It's not like this is a practical option versus like a single server for a home lab.,happiness,excitement,mild
00:19:17,00:19:26,"But if you want to learn how clustering works or build software that scales horizontally, this takes up almost zero space and uses only 60 watts of power.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:19:26,00:19:32,Stack up mini PCs and you'll burn through 100 watts in no time with similar cluster performance on the low end.,happiness,curiosity,mild
00:19:32,00:19:35,How fast does this compile the Linux kernel?,fear,nervousness,mild
00:19:35,00:19:36,"Well, I have a shirt for that.",fear,nervousness,mild
00:19:36,00:19:44,"First of all, go check out redshirtjeff.com, but I set up DIST so I could distribute a Linux kernel, recompile over four compute modules.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:19:44,00:19:47,And normally a compile takes about 45 minutes on a single one.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:19:48,00:19:54,"So with four going at it, it didn't use all the available compute power, but it did get that compile time down to about 22 minutes.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:19:55,00:20:00,"So a little over two times faster with four nodes, which honestly for a cluster that's fine.",happiness,admiration,mild
00:20:00,00:20:10,"Will it ceph technically, yes, you can have distributed storage on a cluster like this with a bunch of NVMe drives, but one gigabit networking isn't the best for that.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:20:10,00:20:17,"If there were some bottlenecks on the kernel compile, there's going to be way more bottlenecks with a distributed file system running over that one gigabit network.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:20:17,00:20:19,Do other compute modules work on it?,fear,nervousness,mild
00:20:19,00:20:20,I don't know yet.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:20:20,00:20:25,"I have almost every other compute module board in existence, so I'll try to test a few when I get some time.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:20:25,00:20:36,"But these things take a lot of time, especially since, unlike with the Raspberry PI, a lot of these clone boards, they're just not well supported and I have enough trouble just testing them outside of a headless cluster environment.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:20:37,00:20:39,What are some actual use cases for it?,fear,nervousness,mild
00:20:39,00:20:46,"If your needs are modest, a tiny multi node home lab for kubernetes or just running separate services on separate machines?",happiness,excitement,mild
00:20:46,00:20:49,That might make sense here for a very small niche of people.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:20:49,00:21:01,"It's actually a nice compact setup for things like CI jobs or distributed compiles that run better on ARM CPUs natively, where you might not have the space or the budget for something like an ampere server.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:21:01,00:21:03,Otherwise this thing's a fun learning platform.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:21:03,00:21:10,"Not everything in your home lab has to be the most practical thing in the world, otherwise there'd be no market for old Dell poweredge servers.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:21:10,00:21:15,Can you run a full DOOM deathmatch on the cluster with each PI running as a different player?,happiness,excitement,mild
00:21:16,00:21:22,"Actually, you might be able to with PI Connect, but latency and the fun of the experience might not be there.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:21:23,00:21:24,Can it play Crysis?,fear,nervousness,mild
00:21:24,00:21:26,"Well, there's actually a chance it could.",fear,nervousness,mild
00:21:26,00:21:39,"It has an M2 slot and I can adapt that to a full size PCIe slot and put a GPU on it, but it's far from the ideal platform for that, and I don't even want to spend the time to try that because I'd have to change everything about it.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:21:39,00:21:42,"In the end, I think you'll fall into one of two camps.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:21:42,00:21:50,"On the one side, it's a fun little cluster board, and it comes with some limitations, but you might be willing to overlook those because it's not that expensive.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:21:51,00:21:58,"On the other side, this is a completely impractical device with no use cases, and Raspberry PIs are overpriced garbage.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:21:59,00:22:11,"For that perspective, I'm not sure if I'll ever convince you that you can still have fun with things that aren't your version of ideal, but for the former Sipeed I think hit a nice spot between cheap and functional with this thing.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:22:11,00:22:16,"It's not perfect and you definitely have to tinker with things to get the right setup for power, performance and noise.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:22:17,00:22:18,But but I'm happy to do that.,happiness,admiration,mild
00:22:18,00:22:24,"It let me play with software I never would have touched without using this thing, like Distributed Llama and Distcc.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:22:24,00:22:32,"Right now, like I said, it's on pre order, but it should be available soon for between 50 to 150 bucks, depending on where you live and what options you choose.",happiness,excitement,mild
00:22:33,00:22:35,"Until next time, I'm Jeff Geerling.",happiness,excitement,mild

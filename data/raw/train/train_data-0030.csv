00:08:31,00:08:32,So I think I suppress it.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:08:32,00:08:41,And I think that's coming out physically because the weird thing is there's been days I felt perfectly fine and then I get a phone call or an email to tell me something that's immediately going to cause me bother.,surprise,confusion,moderate
00:08:41,00:08:44,Maybe it's bad feedback or something like that.,surprise,confusion,mild

00:15:35,00:15:38,So somebody wants to message me when I'm out and about.,fear,nervousness,mild
00:15:38,00:15:48,"If they want to initiate a conversation, they just send it to that number and it comes through to me, that number, that email address, and it comes through to me, which means if someone else is having an emergency somewhere, I can be contacted.",neutral,neutral,mild
00:15:48,00:15:51,"But I've only got the thing, haven't really used it that much.",neutral,neutral,mild
00:15:51,00:16:03,I'm just kind of letting you know that it exists and at some point in the future I'll maybe do like a proper review of Suddenly Got Very Cold.,happiness,optimism,mild
00:16:04,00:16:10,So that's why I've got this screw on the cap.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:16:10,00:16:16,Grab one of your spare socks that you of course have brought with you because you always bring spare socks.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:16:17,00:16:25,Drop the bottle inside the sock and you've got yourself a little hot water bottle.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:16:25,00:16:30,And I'm gonna go and chuck this down the bottom of my sleeping bag so that I do get into it relatively shortly.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:16:30,00:16:31,It's nice and warm.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:16:31,00:16:34,"My fingers, I can't feel the tips of my fingers.",surprise,confusion,moderate
00:16:34,00:16:35,That's how cold it is.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:16:35,00:17:01,"So yeah, I think I'm gonna wait out here for another 15 minutes and then it's gonna be time to get inside the tent, hands in the boots and walk my way in.",neutral,neutral,mild
00:17:26,00:17:27,You know you got to go back.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:17:27,00:17:28,I can get the camera.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:17:30,00:17:36,"So I do find myself somewhat conflicted with this tent, if you can call it a tent.",surprise,confusion,mild
00:17:36,00:17:44,"I mean this look, there's no room whatsoever in here about.",anger,annoyance,moderate
00:17:44,00:17:49,Despite that I have managed to fit me plus all of my stuff like everything I brought is in here.,happiness,pride,moderate
00:17:50,00:17:52,"The bags down in my legs, tripods down the sides.",neutral,neutral,mild
00:17:52,00:17:55,There is just enough space to get all your stuff in.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:17:55,00:17:59,And the conflict with it is it's sort of a bomb proof shelter.,happiness,amusement,mild
00:17:59,00:18:01,"It's incredibly waterproof, it's incredibly windproof.",happiness,admiration,moderate
00:18:02,00:18:08,But you would never actually want to use it in really bad conditions if you had a choice because you can't cook in it.,disgust,aversion,moderate
00:18:08,00:18:13,"Which means if you're using it in bad weather, well how do you cook your food?",happiness,curiosity,mild
00:18:13,00:18:14,You'd have to carry an extra tarp or something.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:18:14,00:18:16,At that point you're carrying extra weight.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:18:16,00:18:20,If you carry an extra weight why not just bring a larger tent?,happiness,amusement,mild
00:18:20,00:18:23,But despite all that there's just something I like about it.,happiness,approval,mild
00:18:23,00:18:24,It's just so quick to pitch.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:18:25,00:18:28,And I have actually bought a tent which was to replace this.,happiness,pride,mild
00:18:28,00:18:31,I bought a Terra Nova laser compact one.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:18:31,00:18:34,It weighs about the same but it's a full S tent.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:18:35,00:18:36,But yet I might in this.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:18:37,00:18:45,I think what I'm going to do is I'm probably going to keep this tent for maybe like summer warmer weather as a fine tonight.,happiness,optimism,mild
00:18:45,00:18:46,It's not the best when it's.,sadness,disappointment,mild
00:18:46,00:18:54,I got kind of cold standing out there so I'm in here earlier than I'd like to be cuz I can't really stay outside but I think I'll keep it for the summer.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:18:54,00:18:57,"I'll keep it for a fast pack and if I'm like running and, and camping.",happiness,desire,mild

00:21:11,00:21:44,No need to get myself warmed up.,neutral,neutral,mild

00:22:42,00:22:45,"Is it pf, PFO free?",happiness,curiosity,mild
00:22:45,00:22:46,Waterproof.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:22:46,00:22:51,"It uses Nikwak technology for its waterproofness, which means that you have to retreat it every now and then.",neutral,neutral,mild
00:22:51,00:23:00,And it's also not as waterproof as like a traditional like bin bag type waterproof jacket like Gore Tex or what have you.,disgust,aversion,mild
00:23:00,00:23:02,But the theory is it's a lot more breathable.,happiness,optimism,mild

00:23:12,00:23:24,"The downside being, from what I've heard so far, is if you're out in a really, really heavy downpour all day, it will kind of soak through, but at the same time that water will be kind of brought out and it'll dry off quicker.",neutral,neutral,mild

00:23:48,00:23:50,It's warmer than I expected.,surprise,surprise,mild
00:23:50,00:23:52,It's basically equivalent to a down jacket.,neutral,neutral,mild

00:23:53,00:23:54,Yeah.,neutral,neutral,mild
00:23:54,00:23:55,Like a thin down jacket.,neutral,neutral,mild
